Book Three: Method
------------------

Quick Start Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What would I say if I had just five minutes to give comprehensive
instructions for awakening?

You are unenlightened to the extent that you are embedded in your
experience. You think that your experience is you. You must dis-embed.
Do this by taking each aspect of experience as object (looking at it and
recognizing it) in a systematic way. Then, surrender entirely.

Do these practices, exactly as written:

First Gear:

1. Objectify body sensations. If you can name them, you
   aren't embedded there. Notice sensations and note to yourself:
   “Pressure, tightness, tension, release, coolness, warmth, softness,
   hardness, tingling, itching, burning, stinging, pulsing, throbbing,
   seeing, tasting, smelling, hearing.” If I am looking at something it is
   not “I”.

2. Objectify feeling-tone. Are sensations pleasant, unpleasant,
   or neutral? Every time you note pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, you
   are dis-embedding from experience.

3. Objectify mind states. Call them
   out as they occur. “Investigation, curiosity, happiness, anxiety,
   amusement, sadness, joy, anger, frustration, annoyance, irritation,
   aversion, desire, disgust, fear, worry, calm, embarrassment, shame,
   self-pity, compassion, love, contentment, dullness, sleepiness, bliss,
   exhilaration, triumph, self-loathing.” Name them and be free. These mind
   states are not “you;” if there is a “you” it must the one who is
   looking, rather than what is being looked at. Below, we will challenge
   the notion that there is any “you” at all.

4. Objectify thoughts.
   Categorize them: planning thought, anticipating thought, worrying
   thought, imaging thought, remembering thought, rehearsing thought,
   scenario spinning thought, fantasy thought, self-recrimination thought.
   Come up with your own vocabulary and see your thoughts as though they
   belonged to someone else. The content of your thoughts is not relevant
   except to the extent that it helps you to label and therefore objectify
   them.

Second Gear:

1. Objectify the apparent subject. Who am “I”? Turn the
   light of attention back on itself. Who knows about this experience? To
   whom is this happening? Spoiler: you will not find a self to whom this
   is happening. Keep looking until this becomes second nature.

Third Gear:

   1. Surrender entirely. Let it be. Good. Now go beyond even
   surrender, to the simple acknowledgement that this moment is as it is,
   with or without your approval. This does not mean that you must be
   passive. Surrender also to activity. You are not in charge. You are the
   little kid in the back seat with the plastic steering wheel. Relax and
   enjoy the ride.

Introduction to the Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method described here is a synthesis of the lessons of my practice
and teaching over the past thirty years. My aim is to present a
systematic, reproducible method for the development of contemplative
fitness. The method works; hundreds of students have used this program
to develop high levels of contemplative fitness. But it is not the only
effective method, nor is it necessarily the best for every individual.
Think of it as similar to a gym routine from a personal fitness trainer;
you can expect it to perform as advertised if you do the work, but it is
not the only way to work out.

While we are developing contemplative excellence, let us also develop a
bit of emotional maturity; I would like to take the moralism out of
meditation. You would never think that your personal fitness trainer is
a better person than you are simply because he can bench press heavier
weights than you; he just works out more and consequently has a skill
set and a fitness level that you do not yet have. This does not make him
a saint. Contemplative development is morally neutral in the same way;
being an expert meditator or being “awakened” does not make you a better
person. Rather, a high level of contemplative fitness means that you
have pumped enough mental iron to develop a set of skills and
competencies that most people do not have. If you want to be a good
person, you must behave like one; simply meditating won't do it for you.

There are many possible variations on contemplative fitness. This method
is one that matches my values and has consistently proven successful in
helping my students develop elite contemplative skills. It trains a
variety of skills and understandings that are valuable on their own, and
can serve as a starting point for further exploration and specialization
depending on individual interests. The course draws on techniques and
concepts I have found useful from Theravada Buddhism as well as various
traditions including Zen, Tibetan Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, Neo-Advaita
and Christian mysticism. You will also find a healthy dose of my unique
contributions; when possible, I will make an effort to point out which
is which in order to avoid confusion.

Depending on his or her interests, the student may or may not decide to
follow the method all the way through. I recommend stream entry, as
described in the chapter by that name, as a wonderful goal for any
meditator. For a more casual meditator, simply reading the following
chapter on the three speed transmission and the techniques compendium in
the appendix may be enough. For the student interested in mapping the
experiences of the contemplative path and gaining facility with altered
states, the later chapters of the method will be of interest. For
someone who seeks elite levels of contemplative fitness, aka spiritual
enlightenment, I recommend that you practice the program in its
entirety. The surest way to arrive at contemplative excellence is to
build a robust practice by triangulating from many different directions.

This is a course for a lifetime of contemplative development. When
someone asks me how long it takes to reach stream entry or some other
mile-marker of progress, I point out that a similarly unanswerable
question would be “how long does it take to be able to do twenty
pushups?” For some people, it is trivial; they can already do twenty
pushups. For others, doing twenty pushups is a big deal, and some people
may never be able to do it in their lifetime. Similarly, with
contemplative fitness there is a great deal of individual variation in
the time it takes to make progress, depending on what you’re bringing to
the table and how much time and energy you are willing to invest. Based
on my experience working with students, we can model a bell curve for
how long it takes to get stream entry, the first goal I recommend to my
students and to the readers of this book. Most people who take on the
project are likely to get stream entry within a year or two. On the tail
ends of the curve, I know people who have been working seriously towards
stream entry for several years and haven't yet gotten it, and I also
know people who managed it within a month or two of getting serious
about their meditation practice. Having attained stream entry, you are
likely to find that there is more to do and that you are more interested
in your meditation practice than ever. Ultimately, there is no end to
contemplative development. Like evolution, it adapts forever, always
changing and moving into new spaces, never resting or growing stale.
Plan on practicing for the rest of your life and falling more deeply in
love with your practice with each passing year.

Trajectory of the course

-  Balance concentration and investigation to progress through the
   Progress of Insight and attain stream entry.
-  You’ve learned to navigate and objectify a wide variety of mind
   states and experiences, in formal practice and in daily life.
-  Use concentration to develop facility with jhanas.
-  You’ve learned to access a variety of blissful absorption states that
   are fun, interesting, and conducive to tranquility.
-  Use 6th jhana to scaffold 2nd gear (self-enquiry) and dwell as the
   Witness.
-  You’ve become less distractible by learning to sustain attention on
   one object instead of many.
-  You’ve learned another way of moving practice into daily life.
-  You’ve learned another valuable perspective: to look at your own
   experience from a dispassionate point of view.
-  See through the Witness by investigating it or letting it run its
   course to scaffold 3rd gear
-  You’ve learned to see your life as process.
-  You’ve leveled the playing field and learned that there is no
   ultimate state; there are many lenses or perspectives of equal
   status.

Three Basic Skills

1. Concentration.
2. Increased perceptual resolution.
3. Increased perceptual acuity.

To understand the difference between perceptual acuity and perceptual
resolution, imagine watching a movie. Higher acuity relates to clarity
and sharpness. With high acuity, can see the images more clearly, see
the colors as rich and saturated, and see what the figures in the movie
are doing in great detail.

Perceptual resolution allows you to drill down to see pixels rather than
a solid shape (this is spatial resolution), and also allows you to see
that, in reality, a movie is a series of still frames projected in quick
succession, creating the illusion of movement (temporal resolution).

Much of the training we will do is designed to strengthen the three
basic skills of concentration, perceptual acuity, and perceptual
resolution. These three skills build the foundation for the entire
program. More complex skills arise naturally when these simple building
blocks are well developed.

Unit 1: Get Stream Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction to Stream Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We begin our training by working towards stream entry, a classical
attainment from Buddhism. There are many ways of interpreting stream
entry, and some traditions don’t discuss it at all. My interpretation is
rooted in the tradition of the late Mahasi Sayadaw, a Burmese meditation
teacher known for bringing meditation beyond the walls of the monastery
to make it available to the common people. In his book, *The Progress of
Insight*, Mahasi outlines stages that a meditator typically experiences
while practicing a specific kind of meditation. [*Mahasi was expanding
on the Visudimagga, a 5th century commentary by Buddaghosa. The
Visudimagga, in turn, was likely influenced by the Vimuttimagga, an
earlier text by Upatissa.*] In this chapter, I will present my
interpretation of this map, modified to remove unnecessary jargon and to
describe the way these stages might be experienced today.

Theravada Buddhism, the Buddhism of Southeast Asia, identifies four
“paths” or levels of enlightenment. These are seen as sequential
attainments, with each path building upon the previous. The first of the
four paths is called stream entry. Of the four stages, stream entry or
first path is the easiest to describe, especially if you use the map
from the Burmese tradition of Mahasi Sayadaw. Within this system, first
path is itself subdivided into sixteen stages. Remarkably, people today
continue to experience this predictable sequence of events and it is
possible to track a meditator's progress as he moves through this
process; this allows a teacher to give encouragement and targeted
guidance all along the way.

The general arc of development goes like this: Meditation is easy, then
it gets hard, then it really catches fire, then it all goes to hell, and
then it stabilizes for a while. It is from this platform of stability
that stream entry (first of the four paths of enlightenment) is reached.
Even a meditator who knows nothing about the maps is likely to go
through these stages. I have spoken with people who found these maps
later in their practice and looking back were able to recognize having
been through the stages described. Because the development through these
stages is not one of linear increases in happiness, knowing about the
maps can help manage the difficult parts of the process. Since anyone
who practices meditation seriously is likely to go through these stages,
it’s helpful to know about them.

The stages encompass the whole spectrum of experience, from the physical
discomfort of sitting down to meditate for the first time, to ecstatic
joy, bliss, fear and misery, and finally, equanimity. Having been
through this roller coaster of highs and lows, a meditator gains a new
level of confidence.

This newfound confidence is one of the benefits of stream entry. Sayadaw
U Pandita once expressed it like this: “When you get to stream entry,
you will be like a *bobo doll*. There is a kind of inflatable doll that
is round on the bottom and weighted with sand so that you can punch it
and knock it over, but it will always pop back up. I do not know what
you call it in your country, but in my country we call it a *bobo
doll*.” [*The bobo doll analogy came while U Pandita was speaking to a
group of foreign (non-Burmese) yogis on long term silent retreat at his
monastery in Rangoon.*]

The most efficient way to attain stream entry is by systematically
investigating the experience of this moment. The most foolproof way to
systematically investigate the experience of this moment is vipassana
meditation via the noting technique. Noting is foolproof because it
provides a real-time feedback loop to keep you on track; you know you
are doing it right because the noting (labeling, either silently or
aloud) is not possible unless you are investigating your experience.

In the four paths model, stream entry is the first stage (path) of
enlightenment and is referred to as “classical enlightenment” by some
teachers, but people often overestimate its effects. Bill Hamilton used
to say that “after all, there are four paths, so how good could the
first one be? Stream entry is only a quarter of the way there.”
Attaining stream entry will not solve all of your problems, but by the
time you have it, you will have gained mastery of a variety of skills
and techniques that lead to more freedom over time, including the
ability to objectify and dis-embed from all kinds of phenomena. Most
meditation systems do not talk about measurable, achievable goals of any
kind, but I strongly encourage all of my students to work towards stream
entry. Having a systematic plan of attack is highly motivating and is
conducive to making progress when learning any skill, including
meditation. Notes:

Introduction to Noting Meditation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    “Labeling technique helps us to perceive clearly the actual
    qualities of our experience, without getting immersed in the
    content.” (Sayadaw U Pandita, *In This Very Life*)

The common thread among all meditation techniques is the activity of
bringing attention to experience. One way of doing this is to label
(note) your experience, silently or aloud, as it happens. This is the
premise of the noting technique, the powerhouse of the yogi toolbox. In
noting, we label our experience using one or two-word notes, at a
consistent pace. Whatever has our attention in any moment can be noted,
and I recommend noting at a pace of between one and three seconds per
note.

Here's a quick experiment to give you a taste of noting. Ask yourself
which of the senses is predominant in this moment. Is it seeing,
hearing, tasting, touching, or smelling? Whichever it is, label it as
such. If you hear a car go by, say “hearing”. If you see these words,
say “seeing”. If you feel the weight of your body on the chair, say
“feeling”. I’m simply asking you to notice which of the senses is
predominant in your experience in this moment. Continue to note in this
way every one to three seconds: seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, or
smelling. You may soon notice another aspect of experience: thinking.
Buddhism identifies six sense doors, including the five body senses
along with thinking as the sixth sense. When thinking comes up, notice
that it's just more sensory input; thinking happens automatically and
without your control, just like seeing or hearing.

The beauty of the noting technique is that as long as you are noting
continuously, every few seconds, you are paying attention to something
happening in the present moment. You’re meditating! If you notice that
more than a few seconds have passed since your last note, that is simply
a reminder to resume noting.

Noting has three main functions:

1. Noting keeps you on track by giving
   you a feedback loop. (If you stop noting, that in itself can be a sign
   that you have wandered off track, giving you the heads-up that it's time
   to refocus.)
2. Noting helps ensure that you have clearly objectified
   and and therefore dis-embedded from whatever you are experiencing.
3. Noting keeps the mind engaged to the point where there is very little
   processing power left for needless suffering in the form of rumination
   or worry.

Noting harnesses the power of the feedback loop, allowing you to stay on
track throughout the meditation session; less time spent in drifting or
mind-wandering results in more efficient use of precious practice time,
something that is especially important for those of us who practice in
daily life. Noting can be done both on and off the cushion. Noting is
failure-proof; it doesn't matter what you’re noting, as long as you are
noting. The benefits of noting are realized irrespective of whether your
meditation is pleasant or unpleasant. A session spent noting boredom,
irritation, frustration, and aversion to noting is considered as
successful as a session where everything is groovy and pleasant. The
objective is not to have nothing but pleasant experiences, but rather to
clearly objectify whatever the experience happens to be.

I first learned the noting technique from Bill Hamilton and continued to
refine it under the direction my Asian teachers from the Mahasi lineage.
The traditional Mahasi instructions for noting while following the
breath are valuable and are presented later in this chapter, but most of
my students have better luck with choiceless noting at first. I
recommend beginning with “four categories” noting and experimenting with
other styles once you feel comfortable with the basic technique.

Noting with 5 Senses (with video)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The five senses are seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling.
Here is a one-minute video demonstrating the technique:

   \end{center}


Noting with 6 Senses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The six sense doors are seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling,
and thinking. Anything we experience must necessarily fall under one of
these categories. The brain forms a holistic experience from all of the
streams of sensory experience, but it is possible to zoom in and notice
which of the senses is taking center stage in any given moment.

When noting at the level of the six sense doors, it isn't necessary to
drill down to specifics. We just notice which of the sense doors is
predominant in this moment. Simply note “seeing,” “hearing,” “touching
(or feeling),” “tasting,” “smelling,” or “thinking,” silently or aloud
every few seconds.
