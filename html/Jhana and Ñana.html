<h1>Five phases of concentration<a class="headerlink" href="#five-phases-of-concentration" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Concentration means different things to different people. I’ll first
explain what I mean by concentration, then talk about current western
Buddhist ideas and misconceptions about it, misconceptions that I
believe have contributed greatly to the glass ceiling effect.</p>
<p>By concentration, I mean the focusing of the mind. This can be a very
tight focus or a very diffuse focus, but in either case, the mind is
gathered together in one place or direction. One way to illustrate this
idea is to think of herding chickens. Chickens are interesting creatures
in that, although they naturally tend to move together as a flock, they
will not hesitate to scatter when they are agitated or startled. I will
describe the five phases of herding chickens. Maybe someday I’ll draw
the five chickenherding pictures, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Phase one: With great effort and determination, you thrust yourself into
the middle of the flock with the intention of focusing on just one
chicken. The chickens, however, are much quicker than you, and scatter
in all directions. You chase them, but the minute you get one of them
in your sights, it veers off and scurries away. You turn your attention
to the next nearest bird and continue the chase. You are not able to
follow any one bird for more than a moment. The very act of singling out
an individual chicken causes it to flee. You feel anxious and
frustrated. This tendency of a chicken to flee when pursued, however, is
built into the dynamics of chicken herding. It doesn’t mean you are
doing it wrong, it’s all part of the natural unfolding of the process.
Although you may be tempted to abandon chicken herding as futile, do not
despair. With perseverance, phase two will eventually arise.</p>
<p>Phase two: You are able, through continuous focus and the application of
just the right amount of effort (learned through trial and error) to
single out one bird and stick to it like glue. Your eyes do not waver
from the target. Wherever it goes, you are sure to follow. If it speeds
up, you speed up. If it slows down, you slow down. When it turns left or
right, you are right on its tail, at just the proper following distance.
A subtle exhilaration arises and you feel happy and alert.</p>
<p>Phase three: Chickens are, after all, flock animals, and they like
nothing better than to run together as a group. If you relax your gaze
just slightly from the chicken in front of you, you will notice that you
are now in the midst of an entire flock of chickens that are moving as
one. You are part of the flock now. You let yourself sink into this
experience, absorbing into and becoming one with the flock. There is
much less effort required here than at stage two, which, in turn,
required less than stage one. You feel a deep joy, a sense of unity
with the world.</p>
<p>Phase four: Your attention becomes even more diffuse and you become
aware of the edges of the flock. The bird in front of you almost
disappears. You are now noticing the entire flock, all at once. Any
effort to tighten the focus of awareness, or single out an individual
bird would pull you back to the earlier stages. You surrender to the
diffuse, almost effortless experience of the fourth stage of chicken
herding. You feel a profound bliss. Having accomplished your end, you
are now free to relish the fruits of your labor. It is good to be alive,
surrendered to the flock.</p>
<p>Phase five: You are fully integrated with the flock, and have become
just another chicken. You are effortlessly aware of not only the
chickens, but of the entire barnyard. Whether standing or sitting,
running uphill or down, happily grubbing for worms or painfully
tripping over chicken wire, you have no preference. Everything is fine
with you. This is the final phase of chicken herding.</p>
<p>The five phases of chicken herding correspond to the five phases of
concentration. My wife pointed out to me the other day that if I wanted
to talk about concentration I should carefully explain what I mean by
the word, as many people think that concentration only refers to the
very tight focus that I refer to as phase two. She is right that this
must be very explicitly taught, because if a yogi believes that only a
very tight focus qualifies as true concentration he or she will never
relax enough to let the higher phases develop.</p>
<p>How does a yogi know whether to practice samatha or vipassana?</p>
<p>There are two very different instructions, depending on whether a yogi
is pre- or post- fourth ñana. A pre- fourth ñana yogi, i.e. one who has
not attained to the level of the Arising and Passing Away of Phenomena,
must put his focus on penetrating the object. A post- fourth ñana yogi
must concentrate. It’s that simple. And the reason, in my opinion, that t
he western dharma scene has been so spectacularly unsuccessful in
producing high levels of attainment in its students is that western
dharma teachers give beginning instruction to intermediate and advanced
students; they tell post- fourth ñana students to ratchet up the
intensity of their vipassana, when they should be telling them to
concentrate their behinds off.</p>
<p>This, in my opinion tragic situation, is due to a misunderstanding that
arose out of a cultural difference. The western vipassana scene, as
exemplified by Insight Meditation Society, is influenced primarily by
Burmese Mahasi-style vipassana. It seems that Burmese people, by and
large, concentrate so well that it is difficult for them to learn
vipassana. This, at least, is the conventional wisdom, and my experience i
n Burma in the early and mid-‘90’s led me to believe that it is,
although a stereotype, generally accurate. Burmese yogis very quickly
attain a deeply concentrated state and it is all the teachers can do to
get them to look clearly at an object. Westerners, on the other hand,
have no concentration whatsoever. We watch television, drink coffee, and
obsess endlessly about our careers and our relationships. We are so
goal-oriented that if you so much as suggest to us that there is
something to gain by striving we will strive from here to eternity. When
Burmese monks give instructions that were designed for Burmese yogis to
American yogis, the result is too much effort and too little
concentration. Without concentration, the strata of mind that contain
advanced insight are never reached. This leads to the chronic achiever,
as Bill Hamilton put it, the yogi that has attained to the all important
fourth ñana, but is unable, year after year, to attain to the Paths.</p>
<p>Once a yogi, whether American, Asian, or otherwise, reaches the fourth
ñana, it is imperative that the teacher recognize this and change the
instruction from effort to concentration. A post 4th ñana yogi is in no
danger of becoming “lost in concentration.” He or she has all the tools
to deconstruct whatever object presents itself to the mind. The
important thing now is to access the relevant mental strata. These
strata are accessed through concentration. There are various techniques
to encourage the development of concentration. Two of my favorites are
counting the breath from one to ten, and kasina practice.</p>

<section id="counting-the-breath-from-one-to-ten">
<h2>Counting the breath from one to ten<a class="headerlink" href="#counting-the-breath-from-one-to-ten" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This deceptively simple but powerful practice is one of my favorites.
While walking, sitting, or reclining, count each exhalation of the
breath. When you arrive at ten, start over. The beauty of this practice
is that it has a built-in feedback monitor. If the mind wanders, you
will keep counting past ten, or lose count entirely. When that happens,
start over at one. I like to do this practice while walking, and often
use it as a warmup for sitting. If, for example, I plan to do kasina
practice (described below), I find it helpful to attain a concentrated
state before sitting down. This saves me the usual five to ten minutes
of fidgeting and allows me to get directly to work. How do I know I am
concentrated enough? Because I was able to count to ten two or three
consecutive times without losing count. It takes the guesswork out of
concentration.</p>
</section>
<section id="kasina-practice">
<h2>Kasina practice<a class="headerlink" href="#kasina-practice" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the gold standard practice for attaining “hard” concentration
and jhana. A kasina is a colored disk that is used as a visual object.
It doesn’t much matter what color, but I favor pastels or earth tones. I
use a cereal bowl. For years I carried around one of those cheap plastic
bowls they use for bathing from tanks in Burma. Mine happened to be
brown, about 8 inches in diameter. You prop the bowl up against the
wall, sit a comfortable distance from it (about 5 to 8 feet) and stare
at it. That’s it. Your mind will go through the five chicken herding
stages described above. At some point you will enter jhana. You will
recognize it as an altered state of consciousness that feels very stable
and very pleasant. Note that the first four jhanas correspond to chicken
herding stages 2 through 5. Each jhana develops in the five stages, so
it is like nested Russian dolls. Jhanas 5-8 are a subset of jhana 4, so
there is always this nested relationship.</p>
<p>I have found both counting and kasina practices to be applicable to both
retreats and daily practice at home. The more I go back and forth
between deep concentration states and daily life activities, the easier
it gets to make a quick and easy transition between them. In fact, there
is a thing I sometimes do for my dharma friends that I call my “parlor
trick,” in which I sit down and cycle through all eight of the material
and immaterial jhanas in less than two minutes. It doesn’t look like
much; I just sit there and shake and roll my eyes up into my head,
holding up fingers to signal jhana numbers. (Although in the higher
jhanas, I always forget which fingers to hold up and the signal system
breaks down.) So they have to take my word for it that I attained all
those jhanas. But I began doing it as a way to show people that jhanas
aren’t something abstract, or something for other people, but rather for
ordinary people like us; they can be learned and cultivated to high
levels and called up instantly, even during daily life. Also, I must
admit, I began doing it as a way to rebel against a western Buddhist
culture that teaches that it is wicked or shameful to admit that you
“have the power of jhana.” What rubbish.</p>

<section id="jhana-nana-and-path">
<h1>Jhana, ñana, and Path<a class="headerlink" href="#jhana-nana-and-path" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>There is a relationship between jhana, ñana and Path. In 1995, I spent
two months at Sayadaw U Kundala’s monastery in Rangoon. U Kundala, a
former disciple of the late Mahasi Sayadaw, is a senior monk, much
beloved, and widely reputed to be an arahat. A few weeks into the
retreat, I began reporting to U Kundala that I was experiencing hundreds
of little flashes of cessation each day, like the winking out of
consciousness for a moment. They came singly or in waves, and I could
induce them at will. On the third day of my trying to explain this to
him through the interpreter, a woman who spoke rather limited English, U
Kundala’s eyes lit up as he said “Oh! That is Magga Phala! (Path and
Fruition, the culmination of one of the Four Paths of Enlightenment).”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “And it’s not the first time this has happened. It also
happened a couple of years ago in Malaysia, but I had to go through the
whole Progress of Insight again.” (As an aside, this is typical of U
Kundala’s openness in speaking to students about their progress, an
attitude that spilled over into the entire community. During our
interviews, U Kundala would talk to me about Second Path. Someone would
overhear and spread the word, and soon people were coming from all over
town to stare lovingly at the western yogi who was making such progress.
People I didn’t know would stop by my room to give me gifts, hoping to
“gain merit” in so doing. One Burmese man took me home (with U Kundala’s
permission) to meet his family, and then drove me around the countryside
exploring Buddhist temples. Throughout the day, he and his cousin asked
me discreet questions about what it was like to have attained Second
Path. After my retreat, everyone treated me like royalty, and one of the
board members of the monastery volunteered to drive me to the airport.
Once at the airport, we did not wait in the queue with the hundreds of
others at the airport, but walked to the head of the line. The board
member, obviously an important man, said a word in Burmese to the
policeman at customs, who waived me through to the empty waiting room at
the gate without so much as checking my ID. As I walked toward the gate,
the man I was with shouted across the crowded airport, “You got two!
Come back for a third!” One can easily see how this sort of thing could
be a distraction, but I tell the story to illustrate how different the
attitude is in some Burmese dharma communities from that of the American
mushroom factory.)</p>
<p>U Kundala was very pleased with this development, and worked with me
over the next few weeks to explore the new territory. He showed me that
I could, by making a resolution, review the Fruition of either First or
Second Path, and compare them side by side. Before attaining Second
Path, however, I had had an exchange with U Kundala that completely
changed my understanding of the ñanas (insight knowledges). I reported
that I found myself able to call up any of the ñanas that I had
experienced so far on the retreat and re-experience them in real time.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “Any jhanic experience can be reviewed by inclining the
mind toward it.”</p>
<p>Jhanic experiences? I was talking about insight knowledges. Was he
saying that ñanas are jhanas? Yes, that is exactly what he was saying.
Ñanas are jhanas, i.e. discrete concentrated states that are hardwired
into our minds. This is why all yogis have similar ideas and insights
when meditating, and they have them in an invariable sequence. There is
an underlying structure, common to all humans, that can be developed
through meditation. A yogi who has developed the first 16 of the insight
knowledges (ñanas) for the first time has attained First Path. It’s
actually quite mechanical, predictable, and not particularly mystical
when seen as a simple matter of human development.</p>
<p>As ñanas are jhanas, they can be lined up alongside the traditional pure
concentration jhanas in order to better understand the territory. As the
yogi develops the mind through insight and concentration, he is moving
through a series of layers, or strata, of mind. Each layer has its own
characteristics and contains within it the blueprint for a particular
insight. The first ñana, for example, corresponds to the first jhana.
That is, the stratum of mind being accessed is the same. To access that
stratum with pure concentration results in the first jhana, a highly
concentrated and pleasant absorption of mind. To access that same
stratum using the investigative technique of vipassana results in the
first insight knowledge, Knowledge of Mind and Body. Below is a list of
all 16 ñanas, along with their corresponding jhanas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>ñana: Mind and Body (corresponds to 1st jhana)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Cause and Effect</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Three Characteristics</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Arising and Passing (corresponds to 2nd jhana)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Dissolution (corresponds to 3rd jhana)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Fear</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Misery</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Disgust</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Desire for Deliverance</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Re-observation</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Equanimity (corresponds to 4th jhana)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Adaptation (one-time event)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Change of Lineage (one-time event)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Path (one-time event)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Fruition (corresponds to cessation, not considered a jhana)</p></li>
<li><p>ñana: Review</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that only four of the 16 ñanas have corresponding jhanas. (The
immaterial jhanas 5-8 are a subset of the 4th jhana.) This is because
the other ñanas, although jhanic states, are not stable. They are
nexuses of energy where, for some reason, the energy roils around and
does not rest comfortably. Being unstable (or as in the case of ñanas
12-14, one-time events), they are not places where a yogi can rest his
mind. It is no coincidence that the pleasant ñanas have correponding
samatha jhanas, whereas the upleasant ñanas do not. Stability is
pleasant. Instability leads to fear, misery, disgust, etc. The system I
am presenting here is my own contribution to the literature. While many
agree that the jhanas and ñanas cover the same territory, the usual
practice, following U Pandita, is to lump a bunch of ñanas together
under the heading of one jhana and call it a “vipassana jhana.” I prefer
the method presented here as it is more precise, and because I believe
it better represents the actual situation.</p>
<p>The 15th ñana, Fruition, is stable but is not considered a jhana.
According to Theravada Buddhism, it is the direct apprehension of
Nibbana. In any case, it is very pleasant and restorative to
re-experience Fruition, and it is one of the benefits of attaining to
any of the Four Paths of Enlightenment. Furthermore, far from being some
esoteric practice only available to robed ascetics, it can be cultivated
to the point where only a few seconds of concentration are required to
get a taste of it. Waiting in line in the supermarket, for example, is
one of my favorite places to experience cessation/fruition.</p>
<p>Bill Hamilton once said that First Path is not like a pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow. It’s more like you’ve been picking up gold pieces all
along the way. First Path is just a pot to keep them in. (This applies
to subsequent Paths as well.) One way to think of it is to consider that
once you attain First Path, you “own” all of the states leading up to
it, and can learn to call them up whenever you want. Whereas before Path
even a yogi who has experienced the Arising and Passing once or many
times is subject to falling below that level once his concentration
weakens (as between retreats), the Sotaphanna, or Stream Enterer, cannot
fall below the level of fourth ñana. This then becomes the platform upon
which to begin building the scaffolding of jhanas and ñanas that lead to
Second Path, and so on. Upon the attainment of Fourth Path, or
arahatship, all of the nexes of energy have been developed, all of the
strata of mind have been accessed and penetrated, and the physioenergetic
development process is complete. From now on, the energy will
recirculate in a stable pattern, and the yogi will feel no further pull
toward this type of energetic development. He has unfettered access to
all strata of mind, and is limited only by his concentration and his
experience of navigating this territory. Needless to say, although there
is a finite number of strata, the permutations and combinations of so
many nexes of energy working in combination are effectively infinite and
no one will ever master all there is to see and feel. The arahat is far
from static. More importantly, the considerable energy that previously
went into ascending the ladder is now freed up for other pursuits, be
they mundane or sublime. Chop wood, carry water, anyone?</p>
<p>As a practical matter, having easy and immediate access to a variety of
jhanas is not only fun and pleasant, it also supports non-dual practice
and living-in-the-world practice, which, unlike physio-energetic
development, have no end.</p>
<p>“Full enlightenment,” then, as defined by the Theravada Buddhists, is
not a mysterious process. It is purely a matter of accessing a finite
number of strata of mind and seeing them clearly. Set ‘em up and knock
‘em down. The “seeing clearly” is automatic, or at least not difficult
for anyone who has crossed the first Arising &amp; Passing of Phenomena (4th
ñana). So concentration is the whole game for an intermediate or
advanced meditator. For those of a poetic or mystical bent, it could
even be a disappointment to learn that we are dealing with such a
mechanistic process. Nevertheless, such is the situation as I see it. In
any case, the subjective experience is far from dry, and there is no
need to abandon the infinitely mysterious non-dual practice while
developing the jhanas.</p>
